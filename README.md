A project that uses machine learning techniques to build a backtesting engine for trading and to analyze stock market data and make predictions.

Resources:
* https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229: Andrew Ng's Stanford ML Course.
* http://pandas.pydata.org/: pandas documentation
* https://docs.scipy.org/doc/: Numpy and Scipy documentation
* https://in.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-for-trading--ud501/: Udacity course on Machine Learning for Trading
* Successful Algorithmic Trading by Ernest Chan
* https://in.udacity.com/course/software-testing--cs258/: Udacity course of Test Driven Development

To implement:
* An engine that allows for prediction and automated trading.
* Sentiment analysis with NLTK to provide information about possibly profitable stocks by combining with data provided by backtesting. (TBD if Goal 1 is met)
